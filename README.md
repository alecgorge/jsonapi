JSONAPI is a plugin for Bukkit that allows you to access data and other information about your server and your players through a simple, yet secure, HTTP API. This allows you to make **awesome websites**, **iPhone apps**, and a way for your **players to purchase goods online and automatically receive them in game**.

However, this plugin won't do all of that by itself. It is simply an API that allows you to assemble the features in a way that makes sense for your needs.
